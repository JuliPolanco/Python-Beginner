#  2D Maze Solver

## About the code
This code was developed to solve the last two mazes proposed by Dr. Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on day six.

## What is Reeborg's World?
Reeborg is a programming environment of a little robot moving in a two-dimensional world. He moves from cell to cell, according to the grid, and
leaves a green line where he moves. The red thick lines are walls, through which Reeborg cannot go.

You can try you own solutions visiting [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json). Have fun with all the mazes!
